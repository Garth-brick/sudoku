# Sudoku (solver)

Technologies Used:
- Python 3.11.4
- PyGame 2.4

## Description
The basic sudoku game. There is a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 boxes which needs to be filled with numbers from 1-9 (inclusive) such that each row, column, and box has each number exactly once.

Currently, this only works on the command line and the backtracking sudoku algorithm can solve any board given to in a reasonable amount of time.

GUI is a work in progress.

## TODO
- Implement GUI
- Implement a timer
- Penciling in values before entering them
- Generate sudoku boards based on difficulty
